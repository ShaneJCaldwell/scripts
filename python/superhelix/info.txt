This is a script I hacked together to draw a 3D superhelix. Initially for figuring out the formulae for graphics for superhelical.com website, it became a challenge to work out the formulas to draw any arbitrary superhelix. 

Some sources online helped out, especially the people at /r/mathematics:

The code was developed from a demo of python, modified based on working out the math for the helix. 

At this point, everything looks good for reasonable pitches, but on high inclines, something still goes wrong and distorts the secondary helix. There's probably still some small factor overlooked. 

Image of equations as derived is provided as an image.  

Slope of the helical incline is c, where the corresponding angle, phi, is arctan(c)

The problem is something to do with a, the central radius. There is no problem at a = 1, but if it is smaller or bigger, then distoration happens.

So, r isn't a + cos(bt), it's a(1+ cos(bt))

Also, the period of the primary versus secondary helix needed to be scaled by cos(phi).

At this point I have it all figured out. So, to walk through the derivation:

Plot first as a helix circling an inclined line on the theta-z plane.

Inclined line meets the origin at angle phi.

Circle with centre on line perpendicular to page moves up line, tracing out helix on the perimeter. 

Centre of the circle is determined by t

Derivation is on scrap paper
